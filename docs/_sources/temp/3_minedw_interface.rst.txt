3.0 MINEDW Interface
====================

Chapter 3 of the **MINEDW** manual provides an overview of the menu
and display options in the **MINEDW** graphical user interface (GUI).
The layout of the main **MINEDW** interface is shown in Figure 3.1.

|image1|
Figure 3.1 The *MINEDW* main interface

The main interface shown in Figure 3.1 consists of the following
components:

1. View Pane (shown in the purple frame),

2. Main Menu banner (shown in the red frame),

3. Toolbar (shown in the green frame), and

4. Control Panel (shown in the yellow frame).

3.1  View Pane
--------------

View Panes are used to store plots and function as a window that can be
opened and closed. The View Pane without any plot items is defined as
the base View Pane as shown in Figure 3.1. The base View Pane is a
unique View Pane (there is only one) in that it is permanent and cannot
be closed, although it can be hidden from view.

The assembly of plot items within a View Pane is performed using the
Control Panel, which provides tools that can be used to define the
contents of the plot (plot items) and the appearance of those items. A
description of the Control Panel is provided in later sections. Plots
typically consist of a model mesh, geologic setting, wells, boundary
conditions, model outputs, and legend, as shown in Figure 3.2. Note that
the Control Panel is turned off in Figure 3.2 in order to illustrate the
View Pane.

The plot items in a specific View Pane can be saved in views using the
“\ *View*\ ” menu. There is no limit to the number of View Panes that
can be created and saved. Each saved View Pane is listed under the
“\ *View*\ ” menu and can be retrieved for viewing or permanently
deleted using this menu.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The “\ *File*\ ” drop-down menu contains the items shown in Figure 3.4,
below. Detailed descriptions of each menu item are provided following
Figure 3.4.

|image5|

Figure 3.4 “\ *File*\ ” drop-down menu

*New Project:* Creates a new project.

*Open Project:* Opens an existing project.

*Save Project:* Saves the current project file. This menu item remains
inactive unless there is a change to the modeling components such as
geologic setting, boundary condition, etc.

*Save Project As:* Saves a copy of the current project file using a
different file name.

*Close Project:* Closes the project.

*Print Base:* Selects the printing device and prints the base image.

*Export Base:* Exports the base image as a bitmap, .DXF, .VRML,
postscript, or .SVG file.

*Import:* Imports a **MINEDW** project, *a* *FEFLOW* data set or a
stereolithography file containing a finite-element mesh. After the
“\ *Import*\ ” button is clicked, an “\ *Import File*\ ” dialog box
opens and provides four options. A user can import a **MINEDW**
data-file list (.FEL) that was created for **MINEDW** model
simulations, a **MINEDW** geometry file (.PST) that was created with
the mesh generator from **MINEDW** **2.10**, a geometry file (.STL)
that was created using *Rhinoceros 3D*, a *FEFLOW* ASCII data file
(.FEM), or a *FEFLOW* ASCII result file (.DAC). If a **MINEDW**
data-set file (.FEL) is used, then all information related to the
model—except the results—is imported; however, if a **MINEDW**
geometry file (.PST) is used, then only the geometry and the geologic
zone information are imported. Importing model data sets is discussed in
detail in Chapter 4.

*Export:* Exports the model in a *FEFLOW*-supported format that can be
imported into *FEFLOW* for simulation.

*Quit:* Exits **MINEDW**. When the “\ *Quit*\ ” menu item is selected,
a warning message appears reminding the user to save the project if it
has not been saved, as shown in Figure 3.5. If “\ *Discard*\ ” is
selected, then all unsaved changes to the model are lost. To save a
project or changes to an existing project, the file must be saved before
the “\ *Quit*\ ” command is used.

3.4  Control Panel Pane
-----------------------

The “\ *Control Panel*\ ” Pane contains three sub-panes: 1) “\ *Plot
Items*,” 2) “\ *View*,” and 3) “\ *Information*\ ” (as shown in Figure
3.1). The “\ *Plot Item*\ ” sub-pane is used to build plots by adding
items to the view and specifying their appearance using the available
options. The “\ *View*\ ” sub-pane provides tools for manipulating the
view (e.g., rotation, magnification, and position). The
“\ *Information*\ ” sub-pane displays information (e.g., location and
ID) pertaining to items in the current plot when the cursor is
positioned over a specific item in the view. The “\ *Plot Items*\ ” and
“\ *View*\ ” sub-panes are each divided into two sections that can be
independently minimized. Each sub-pane set can be displayed or hidden
using the control buttons on the toolbar (shown in Figure 3.21).

3.4.1  Plot Items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In **MINEDW,** plot items are 2-D or 3-D representations of node or
element properties and model output such as particle tracks and open-pit
seepage. As shown in Figure 3.22 (the **MINEDW** interface), the
“\ *Plot Items*\ ” sub-pane contains two sections. The upper section
shows the list of plot items, and the lower section offers the option of
displaying the attributes or selecting other plot items to be displayed.
When a plot item is highlighted, the attributes associated with that
item become active. The plot item can be activated (made visible) or
deactivated (made invisible) by clicking the ellipse icon to the left of
the plot item. Additionally, right-clicking on a plot item brings up a
menu that allows the user to activate, deactivate, or delete a plot
item.

|image40|

Figure 3.22 The *MINEDW* main interface

The “\ *Plot Items*\ ” sub-pane contains three groups, differentiated by
color. The first group contains three special plot items, 1)
“\ *Legend*,” 2) “\ *Display Settings*,” and 3) “\ *Global Settings*\ ”
(shown below and in **MINEDW** in blue), that are included on all
plots. The second group consists of 1) “\ *Axes*,” 2) “\ *Observation*,”
3) “\ *Boundary Conditions*,” 4) “\ *Element*,” 5) “\ *File Data*,” 6)
“\ *Node*,” and 7) “\ *Post Processing*\ ” (shown below and in
**MINEDW** in black); each can be added to the plot. The third group
of plot items contains “\ *Cutting Planes*\ ” and “\ *Clip Box*\ ”
(shown below and in **MINEDW** in green), which can be added to the
plot to create different cross-section views through the model domain.

The following list (Figure 3.23) provides the **MINEDW** plot items in
their respective colors.

Figure 3.23 *MINEDW* plot items

3.4.1.1  Legend
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

“\ *Legend*\ ” is a local copy of the legend’s settings that are in
effect for the current plot. The options can be set in the “\ *Plot
Items*\ ” sub-pane or via the “\ `*Options*\ ” dialog box found under
the “\ *Tools*\ ” menu on the Main Menu banner. Setting the options on
the current plot does not change them in the “\ *Options*\ ” dialog box 
and does not affect the settings of other plots. The attributes associated
with legends are described below.

*Placement:* Sets the position of the legend to one of three preset
options: 1) “\ *Left”* (side of view), 2) “\ *Right”* (side of view), or
3) “\ *Floating*.” For a floating legend, the width, height, and
position attributes can be set.

*Width:* Sets the width of the legend as a percentage of the View Pane
containing the plot.

*Height:* Sets the height of the legend as a percentage of the View Pane
containing the plot. This setting is only applicable if the legend
“\ *Placement*\ ” attribute is set to “\ *Floating*.”

*Position:* Specifies the left-side position and bottom position of the
plot item as a percentage of the available rendering area. It uses a
scale of 0 to 100, in which 0 indicates the bottom-left corner and 100
indicates the top-right corner. This setting is only applicable if the
legend “\ *Placement*\ ” attribute is set to “\ *Floating*.”

*Outline:* Sets the visibility, color, and thickness of the item’s
outline.

*Heading:* Sets the color of the legend heading.

*Copyright:* Sets the color of the copyright notice in the legend.

*View Info:* Sets the visibility of the current view orientation report
in the legend. The report can include the following items—each of which
can be selected individually for inclusion in the view info in the
legend—“\ *Center*,” “\ *Eye*,” “\ *Dip/DD/Roll*,” “\ *Normal*,”
“\ *Radius*,” and “\ *Projection*.” Sub-controls for each of the items
are provided for specifying the size, font, style, and color of the text
used.

*Step:* This option is inactive in **MINEDW**.

*Time:* Sets the visibility of the time in the legend. The time used is
that at which the view was last modified. The sub-controls provided can
specify the size, font, style, and color of the text used to display the
time in the legend.

*Customer Title:* This option is not valid in **MINEDW**.

On the *“Attributes”* tab for the *“Legend”* item, the legend settings
for each of the plot items that the user has added to the current plot
are also listed beneath the “\ *Customer Title”* attribute. The controls
provided can add or remove the plot item from the legend and specify the
size, font, style, and color of the text. In the case of plot items that
have multiple sub-parts, such as contours or units, the user can add or
remove the individual sub-labels from the legend.

3.4.1.2  Display Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

“\ *Display Settings*\ ” is a local copy of the display settings that
are in effect for the current plot. The options can be set in the
“\ *Plot Items*\ ” sub-pane or via the “\ `*Options*\ ”
dialog box found under the “\ *Tools*\ ” menu on the Main Menu banner. Setting
the display on the current plot does not change the display options in
the “\ *Options*\ ” dialog box and does not affect the settings of other
plots. Additionally, display attributes changed in the “\ *Options*\ ”
dialog box take effect only after **MINEDW** is restarted. The
attributes available under “\ *Display Settings*\ ” and their
descriptions are presented below.

*Name:* Indicates the name of the active view. For all views except the
Base View, this control can be used to name or rename the current view.

*Active:* Controls whether the view is active or inactive.

*Auto Update:* Sets the option of whether to auto-update the view while
cycling (this is enabled via a checkbox). The interval for updating is
found under the “\ *Global Settings*\ ” plot item because the interval
is the same for all auto-updating views.

*Background:* Sets the background color of the view.

*Outline:* Sets the visibility, color, and thickness of the item’s
outline.

*Job Title:* This option is inactive in **MINEDW**.

*View Title:* Sets the visibility of the title. The sub-controls
provided can specify the size, font, style, color, and title displayed
in the plot.

*Target:* This option is inactive in **MINEDW**.*

*Movie:* This option is inactive in **MINEDW**.

3.4.1.3  Global Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

“\ *Global Settings*\ ” is a local copy of the global settings that are
in effect for the current plot. The options can be set in the “\ *Plot
Items*\ ” sub-pane or via the “\ `*Options*\ ”
dialog box found under the “\ *Tools*\ ” menu on the Main Menu banner. Changing
the settings on the current plot also sets them in the “\ *Options*\ ”
dialog box and subsequently affects all plots because these changes are
applied globally. The attributes available under “\ *Global Settings*\ ”
and their descriptions are listed below.

*Vertex Arrays:* Specifies whether vertex arrays are used to draw
objects in Open Graphics Library. The default setting is “on.” When
using older OpenGL display drivers, disabling this attribute can improve
images sometimes. Note that disabling this attribute implies that the
vertex buffer objects are also turned off.

*Vertex Buffer Objects:* Determines whether the vertex buffer object
OpenGL extension is used (if available). The default setting is “on.”
Note that disabling this attribute can improve images when using display
drivers that presently report this extension but do not properly support
it.

*Interactive1:* This option is inactive in **MINEDW**.

*Interactive2:* This option is inactive in **MINEDW**.

*Picking:* This option is inactive in **MINEDW**.

*Sketch Mode:* Renders the item using a reduced (rather than full)
rendering method, which can accelerate response in certain rendering
situations (e.g., model rotation).

*Update Interval:* This option is inactive in **MINEDW**.

*Print Size:* Sets the width and height of the output sent to a printer
or to a bitmap file.

*DXF Warning:* Option to display the warning about styling when a .DXF
file is exported.

*VRML Warning:* Option to display the warning about styling when a .VRML
file is exported.

*Movie:* This option is inactive in **MINEDW**.

The second group of “\ *Plot Items*\ ” consists of “\ *Axes*,”
“\ *Observation*,” “\ *Boundary* *Conditions*,” “\ *Element*,” “\ *File*
*Data*,” “\ *Node*,” and “\ *Post* *Processing*\ ” (shown in
**MINEDW** and Figure 3.23 in black), which can be added to the plot
items. These are discussed in more detail in the following sections.

3.4.1.4  Axes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The “\ *Axes*\ ” plot item is an interactive orientation indicator that
can be displayed as *x*-, *y*-, and *z*-axes or as compass points. The
attributes available for axes and their descriptions are given below.

*AutoConf:* Sets the axes display as either *x*-, *y*-, and *z*-axes or
as compass points by clicking the icons shown.

*X-Axis:* The *x*-axis display with sub-controls for specifying color,
draw (in positive, negative, or both directions), “+” label, and “-”
label (the axis label in positive and negative directions).

*Y-Axis:* The *y*-axis display with sub-controls for specifying color,
draw (in positive, negative, or both directions), “+” label, and “-”
label (the axis label in positive and negative directions).

*Z-Axis:* The *z*-axis display with sub-controls for specifying color,
draw (in positive, negative, or both directions), “+” label, and “-”
label (the axis label in positive and negative directions).

*Fixed:* When enabled, this control fixes the axes to a location on the
screen. Use the “Screen” attribute to specify the position. When
disabled, this control positions the axes in model space.

*Scale:* Specifies a size in percentage units when the axes are fixed.

| *Screen:* Specifies the *x* and *y* position of the axis center in
  percentage units
| (0, 0 = bottom left; 100, 100 = top right) when the axes are fixed.

*Size:* Specifies the axes size in model units when the axes are not
fixed.

*Position:* Places the origin of the axis at the *x*-, *y*-, and
*z*-position (in model units) specified when the axes are not fixed.

*Font:* Specifies the font, size, and style (e.g., normal, bold, italic)
used by the plot item.

*Transparency:* Specifies the plot item’s transparency (0 = solid, 100 =
invisible).

*Caption:* When enabled, this control shows the plot item (labeled,
described, and enumerated as needed) in the plot legend. The
sub-attributes provided are dynamic and contingent on the plot item and
its display requirements in the legend. At a minimum, all captions have
a “\ *Title*\ ” sub-attribute.

3.4.1.5  Observation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The “\ *Observation*\ ” plot item includes the display settings for
observation wells. The display attributes available for observation
wells and their descriptions are given below.

*Map:* This attribute positions, scales, and orients the plot item via
the sub-attributes. Sub-attributes include 1) axes, which specify a
coordinate substitution to use assuming a standard order of “\ *x*, *y*,
*z*\ ” (“*xzy*,” for instance, indicates that the *y* and *z*
coordinates are to be swapped); 2) offset (or translate), which
specifies values for *x*, *y*, and *z* plot-item position offsets; and
3) scale, which multiplies the coordinate system by the specified value.

*Colors:* Specifies the number of colors to use on the plot. Includes
sub-attributes that enumerate the indexed items to enable specification
of color by item. Observation wells are colored by borehole, piezometer,
and transducer.

Line: Sets the thickness and style of the line(s) used to represent the
screen interval of the observation well or piezometer.

*Scale:* Specifies a size in percentage units when the axes are fixed.

*Text*: Displays the labels of the observation wells. By toggling the
arrow, the label properties can be changed.

*Transparency:* Specifies the plot item’s transparency (0 = solid, 100 =
invisible; note that 70 is the minimum value that can be input).

*Caption:* When this control is selected, the plot item is shown
(labeled, described, and enumerated as needed) in the plot legend. The
sub-attributes provided are dynamic and contingent on the plot item and
its display requirements in the legend. At a minimum, all captions have
“\ *Title*\ ” or *“Line”* and “\ *Color”* sub-attributes.

*Toggle Well*: Provides a list of each observation well that is included
in the plot. Individual observation wells can be removed from the View
Pane. This function allows the user to include some or all observations
when exporting a .DXF file from **MINEDW**.

*Section Distance:* This feature is used in conjunction with a
cross-section view. It allows the user to specify which observation
locations to display by using a distance. For example, if a user creates
a cross section and wishes to display observation locations within 100
meters of the cross-section plane, they would enter “100” in the box
next to the attribute label if the coordinate system used in the model
is in meters.

3.4.1.6  Boundary Conditions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The “\ *Boundary Conditions*\ ” plot item includes the display settings
for boundary conditions. The boundary conditions include “\ *Constant
Head & Drain*,” “\ *Pumping Well*,” “\ *River*,” and “\ *Variable
Flux*.” The display attributes available for boundary conditions and
their descriptions are given below. Detailed information about the
boundary conditions can be found in Section 7.4.

*Map:* This attribute positions, scales, and orients the plot item via
the sub-attributes. Sub-attributes include 1) axes, which specify a
coordinate substitution to use assuming a standard order of “\ *x*, *y*,
*z”* (“*xzy*,” for instance, indicates that the *y* and *z* coordinates
are to be swapped); 2) offset (or translate), which specifies values for
*x*, *y*, and *z* plot-item position offsets; and 3) scale, which
multiplies the coordinate system by the specified value.

*Scale:* Specifies the size of the plot item.

*Colors:* For the “\ *Constant Head”* boundary condition, this option is
called “\ *Groups.” “Colors”* or “\ *Groups”* (*Constant Head*)
specifies the colors to use on the plot, with sub-attributes that
enumerate the indexed items to enable specification of color by item.

*Line:* Sets the thickness and style of the lines used to represent the
plot item.

*Transparency:* Specifies the plot item’s transparency (0 = solid, 100 =
invisible).

*Caption:* When enabled, the plot item is shown (labeled, described, and
enumerated as needed) in the plot legend. The sub-attributes provided
are dynamic and contingent on the plot item and its display requirements
in the legend. At a minimum, all captions have “\ *Title*\ ” or *“Line”*
and “\ *Color”* sub-attributes.

*Dynamic:* This option only applies to “\ *Constant Head & Drain*\ ”
boundary conditions and is used to visualize boundary conditions that
become active/inactive at different times through the model simulation.

*Text:* This attribute sets the font style, text size, and text style of
the labels of the boundary conditions displayed in the View Pane.

*Maximum Flux:* This option is only valid for the “\ *Variable Flux*\ ”
boundary condition. By specifying a value, the user can specify the
upper limit of flux values to display. Flux values larger than the
specified value will not be displayed.

*Flux View:* This option enables the display of flux values from the
“\ *Variable Flux*\ ” boundary condition using both color and marker
size to represent the relative magnitudes of flux.

*Section Distance:* This feature is used in conjunction with a
cross-section view and only applies to the “\ *Pumping Well”* plot item.
It allows the user to specify which observation locations to display by
using a distance in model units. For example, if a user creates a cross
section and wishes to display observation locations within 100 meters of
the cross-section plane, they would enter “100” in the box next to the
attribute label.

*Toggle Well:* This attribute applies specifically to the “\ *Pumping
Well”* plot item. It can be used to toggle the display of each well on
or off. This attribute is similar to the “\ *Colors”* and “\ *Groups”*
attributes but does not allow the user to change the display color of
wells.

3.4.1.7  Element
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The “\ *Element*\ ” plot items include 2-D and 3-D plot items that can
be used to display properties of elements. These properties include
geologic zones, recharge, evaporation, hydraulic properties, and
time-varied conductivity. “\ *Element*\ ” plot items also include the
“\ *Pinch-Out*\ ” plot item, which can be used to view and assign
pinch-outs in the model.

*2-D Plane:* Displays element information for the geologic zone,
recharge, or evaporation in 2-D.

*3D Element:* Displays element information for the geologic zone in 3-D.

*Pinch-Out:* Allows the user to create areas of refined vertical
discretization and display these areas.

items.

*Layer:* Indicates which layer of the model to display on the plot. This
attribute pertains to the “\ *2-D Plane*,” “\ *3D Element,”* and
“\ *Properties”* plot items.

*Map:* This attribute positions, scales, and orients the plot item via
the sub-attributes. Sub-attributes include 1) axes, which specify a
coordinate substitution to use assuming a standard order of “\ *x*, *y*,
*z”* (“*xzy*,” for instance, indicates that the *y* and *z* coordinates
are to be swapped); 2) offset (or translate), which specifies values for
*x*, *y*, and *z* plot-item position offsets; and 3) scale, which
multiplies the coordinate system by the specified value.

*Contour:* Provides sub-attributes for controlling contour display.
These are 1) “\ *Ramp*,” which defines the color ramp to use (grayscale,
rainbow, etc.); 2) “\ *Maximum*,” which specifies (or automatically
calculates) the maximum value (right-hand end of the ramp); 3)
“\ *Minimum*,” which specifies (or automatically calculates) the minimum
value (left-hand end of the ramp); 4) “\ *Interval*,” which specifies
(or automatically calculates) the interval between colors on the ramp;
5) “\ *Reversed*,” which inverts the display of the maximum and minimum
values relative to the ramp; 6) “\ *Below*,” which specifies (or
automatically selects) the color to use for displaying values that are
less than those specified by “\ *Minimum*\ ”; and 7) “\ *Above*,” which
specifies (or automatically selects) the color to use for displaying
values that are greater than those specified by “\ *Maximum*.” This
attribute is only available for the “\ *Properties”* plot item.

*Colors:* Allows the user to specify the colors to be used in the plot.
This attribute also allows the user to select which items they wish to
display in the plot by activating the checkbox next to the item. This
attribute can be found for the “\ *2-D Plane,”* “\ *Pinch-Out,”* and
“\ *ZOR”* plot items.

*Zones:* This attribute is available for the “\ *3D Element”* plot item
and allows the user to specify which of the geologic zones are visible
in the plot.

*Fill:* Specifies whether polygons rendered by a plot item should be
filled.

*Wireframe:* Specifies whether the plot item should display with a
wireframe and deter­mines the color and the line thickness of the
displayed wireframe.

*Wire Trans*.: Specifies the amount of transparency to apply to the
wireframe (0 = solid, 100 = invisible).

*Cull Backface:* Specifies whether backface culling is enabled. When set
to “on,” the backfaces of polygons are not rendered (it is often
necessary to disable this function to see the far side of some cut-plane
plots).

*Lighting:* Option to turn lighting on or off. Lighting provides depth
to the plot item because it creates natural shadows.

*Offset:* Specifies settings for the OpenGL polygon offset. If the
polygons are rendered poorly, then setting these values close to zero
might improve performance. The first value specifies a scale factor to
create a variable-depth offset for each polygon; the second value
creates a constant-depth offset.

*Cutline:* Specifies the line thickness of lines plotted on a cutting
plane.

*Cutplane:* This option is only active when a cutplane plot item is
added to the plot view. The options for “\ *Cutplane*\ ” are “\ *On,*\ ”
“\ *Front,*\ ” and “\ *Back,*\ ” which turn on the cutplane, make the
model domain on the front of the cutplane visible, and make the model
domain on the back of the cutplane visible, respectively.

*Clip Box:* Specifies which of the clip box items available in the
current view to apply to the current plot item. This option is only
active when a clip box plot item is added to the plot view.

*Transparency:* Specifies the plot item’s transparency (0 = solid, 100 =
invisible).

*Caption:* When enabled, the plot item is shown (labeled, described, and
enumerated as needed) in the plot legend. The sub-attributes provided
are dynamic and contingent on the plot item and its display requirements
in the legend. At a minimum, all captions have “\ *Title*\ ” or
“\ *Colors*\ ” and “\ *Label*\ ” sub-attributes.

*To Data File:* Saves the .DXF file to a text file format that can be
used for creating an open-pit mine plan.

**ESRI Shapefile (SHP):** This plot item is used to import a shapefile
(.SHP), a common ArcGIS\ :sup:`©` file format, to the current view. A
shapefile is a popular geospatial vector data format for geographic
information systems software. Shapefiles spatially describe
geometries—points, polylines, and polygons. A shapefile is actually a
group of several files, three of which are required to form a valid set.
A valid shapefile set contains at least a main file (.SHP), a dBASE file
(.DBF), and an index file (.SHX). The main file contains spatial
information about features (e.g., coordinates along a line or polygon),
the dBASE file contains a table of attributes related to those spatial
features (e.g., the name of a feature or some measurement taken at a
feature), and the index file indexes the byte-location of features
within a .SHP file. The attributes available for this option and their
descriptions are provided below.

*File:* Use the plus sign (+) available for this attribute to display
the “\ *Select SHP file*\ ” dialog box to select which .SHP files to
load. Once loaded, the file name is shown in this attribute.

*Attribute Table:* Displays the contents of the dBASE file. A dBASE file
contains a table of attributes associated with the features defined in a
shapefile.

*Coordinate Info:* Displays the contents of a .PRJ file (a .PRJ
shapefile is not related to the .PRJ file created by **MINEDW**). A
.PRJ file contains information about the coordinate system and
projection in which the shapefile features are defined. A .PRJ file may
or may not be present.

*Group by:* Specifies an attribute of the dBASE file with which to group
features. Each group is given a unique color and label in the legend and
view. To display all features as separate entities, select the last item
(Record ID) from the drop-down menu.

*Label by:* Specifies an attribute of the dBASE file by which to label
features within the view. Because an apparently single feature may be
defined in a shapefile as several features (e.g., a line composed of
line segments), duplicate labels may appear.

*Project to Surface:* Projects the .SHP file to the ground surface.

*Symbol:* Specifies the symbol to represent the data.

*Scale:* Specifies the size of the symbol.

*Colors:* Specifies the colors of features in the shapefile.

*Line:* Specifies line thickness of the data.

*Map:* This control positions, scales, and orients the plot item via the
sub-attributes. Sub-attributes include 1) axes, which specify a
coordinate substitution to use assuming a standard order of “\ *x*, *y*,
*z*\ ” (“*xzy*,” for instance, indicates that the *y* and *z*
coordinates are to be swapped); 2) offset (or translate), which
specifies values for *x*, *y*, and *z* plot-item position offsets; and
3) scale, which multiplies the coordinate system by the specified value.

*Text:* Specifies the font used for labels.

points. The attributes available for this option and their descriptions
are given below.

*File:* Use the plus sign (+) available for this attribute to display
the “\ *Select Data File*\ ” dialog box to select which .DAT files to
load. Once loaded, the file name is shown in this attribute.

*Project to Surface:* Projects the .DAT file to the ground surface.

*Text:* Specifies the font used for labels.

*Map:* This control positions, scales, and orients the plot item via the
sub-attributes. Sub-attributes include 1) axes, which specify a
coordinate substitution to use assuming a standard order of “\ *x*, *y*,
*z*\ ” (“*xzy*,” for instance, indicates that the *y* and *z*
coordinates are to be swapped); 2) offset (or translate), which

These are 1) “Ramp,” which defines the color ramp to use (grayscale,
rainbow, etc.); 2) “\ *Maximum*,” which specifies (or automatically
calculates) the maximum value (right-hand end of the ramp); 3)
“\ *Minimum*,” which specifies (or automatically calculates) the minimum
value (left-hand end of the ramp); 4) “\ *Interval*,” which specifies
(or automatically calculates) the interval between colors on the ramp;
5) “\ *Reversed*,” which inverts the display of the maximum and minimum
values relative to the ramp; 6) “\ *Below*,” which specifies (or
automatically selects) the color to use for displaying values that are
less than those specified by “\ *Minimum*\ ”; and 7) “\ *Above*,” which
specifies (or automatically selects) the color to use for displaying
values that are greater than those specified by “\ *Maximum*.”

*Fill:* Specifies whether polygons rendered by a plot item should be
filled.

*Line:* Sets the thickness and color of the lines used to represent the
plot item. The attribute is only available for the *Isoline* plot item.

*Wireframe:* Specifies whether the plot item should display with a
finite-element mesh wireframe as well as the color and the line
thickness of the wireframe.

*Wire Trans.:* Specifies the wireframe’s transparency (0 = solid, 100 =
invisible).

*Cull Backface:* Specifies whether backface culling is enabled. When
this setting is enabled, the backfaces of polygons are not rendered (it
often is necessary to turn off this feature to see the far side of some
cutplane plots).

*Lighting:* Enables the lighting.

*Offset:* Specifies settings for the OpenGL polygon offset. If the
polygons are rendered poorly, then setting these values close to zero
might improve performance. The first value is a factor that specifies a
scale factor to create a variable-depth offset for each polygon; the
second value is used to create a constant-depth offset.

*Cutline:* Specifies the line thickness of lines plotted on a cutting
plane.

*Cutplane:* Option for displaying the model domain in front of or behind
(or both) a cross-section plane. This option is useful when orienting
the cross-section plane.

*Clip Box:* Specifies which of the clip box items available in the
current view to apply to the current plot item.

*Transparency:* Specifies the plot item’s transparency (0 = solid, 100 =
invisible).

*Caption:* When enabled, the plot item is shown (labeled, described, and
enumerated as needed) in the plot legend. The sub-attributes provided
are dynamic and contingent on the plot item and its display requirements
in the legend. At a minimum, all captions have “\ *Title*\ ” or
“\ *Colors*\ ” and “\ *Label*\ ” sub-attributes.

3.4.1.10  Post Processing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Pit Flux:* This option can be used to display the seepage that occurs
at the pit wall, which is recorded by **MINEDW** during the model
simulation in the file with a .SEP extension (Section 9.6).

*Particle Tracking:* Displays particle-tracking results (Section 9.4).

The attributes related to these two plot items are described below.

*File:* The icon next to the “\ *File”* attribute opens a dialog box
that is used to import particle tracks or drain nodes. The attribute is
available for both the “\ *Particle Tracking”* and “\ *Pit Flux”* plot
items.

*Arrow Scale:* This attribute controls the size of the arrow displayed
on the particle tracks that indicate direction.

*ColorByMag:* The magnitude of the velocity along the displayed particle
tracks can be shown by using this attribute. This attribute allows the
selection of a number of color ramps and allows the “\ *Maximum*,”
“\ *Minimum,”* and “\ *Interval”* to be defined.

*Colors:* This attribute can be used to control the display color of
particle tracks and of “\ *Pit Flux”* nodes.

*Line:* Sets the thickness and color of the lines used to represent the
“\ *Particle Tracking”* plot item.

*Map:* This attribute positions, scales, and orients the plot item via
the sub-attributes. Sub-attributes include 1) axes, which specify a
coordinate substitution to use assuming a standard order of “\ *x*, *y*,
*z*\ ” (“*xzy*,” for instance, indicates that the *y* and *z*
coordinates are to be swapped); 2) offset (or translate), which
specifies values for *x*, y, and *z* plot-item position offsets; and 3)
scale, which multiplies the coordinate system by the specified value.

*Scale:* Controls the size of the displayed particle track.

*Transparency:* Specifies the plot item’s transparency (0 = solid, 100 =
invisible).

*Caption:* When enabled, the plot item is shown (labeled, described, and
enumerated as needed) in the plot legend. The sub-attributes provided
are dynamic and contingent on the plot item and its display requirements
in the legend. At a minimum, all captions have “\ *Title*\ ” or
“\ *Colors*\ ” and “\ *Label*\ ” sub-attributes.

*Flux View:* This option enables the display of flux values from the
“\ *Pit Flux*\ ” boundary conditions using both color and marker size to
represent the relative magnitudes of flux.

*Minimum Flux:* Sets the minimum absolute flux value to display using
the “\ *Pit Flux*\ ” boundary condition.

*Maximum Flux:* Sets the maximum absolute flux value to display using
the “\ *Pit Flux*\ ” boundary condition.

*Excluded Flux:* Option to enable the display of flux values outside of
the specified minimum and maximum flux values.

3.4.1.11  Cutting Planes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The third “\ *Plot Items*\ ” group, “\ *Cutting Planes,*\ ” contains
“\ *Plane,” “Wedge,” “Octant,”* and “\ *Clip Box*\ ” (displayed in green
in **MINEDW**). These items are similar to plot items (and are handled
as plot items) in that they are independent objects appearing in the
plot. They are distinct from plot items in that they are applied to one
or more plot items for the purpose of visualization and, as such, are
dependent on plot items (a cutplane can be defined as part of a plot,
but until it is applied to at least one plot item, its rendering is
incomplete and is not visible in the View Pane).

The “\ *Cutting Planes*\ ” group contains three items: 1) “\ *Plane*,”
2) “\ *Wedge*,” and 3) “\ *Octant*.” All three items have the same
attributes.

*Plane:* The plane cut can be applied to plot items to “slice” them into
2-D. A plane is manipulated using its “\ *Origin*,” which can be
repositioned to move the cutplane, and the visible surface of the plane
itself can be rotated in the View Pane to view different aspects of the
plane.

*Wedge*: The wedge cutplane can be applied to plot items to “slice” the
model into a wedge shape that is defined by two planes joined along an
origin. The plane is manipulated using its “\ *Origin*,” which can be
changed to reposition the location of the cutplane.

*Octant:* The octant cutplane provides a cubical cutplane that can be
applied to plot items to “slice” them in three orthogonal directions
simultaneously. The plane is manipulated using its “\ *Origin*,” which
can be repositioned. The visible surface of the plane itself can be
dragged to rotate the plane three-dimensionally.

The attributes available for cutting planes and their descriptions are
given below.

*Name:* Sets or indicates the name of the cutplane. This name is used to
label the cutplane as it is listed in the “\ *Plot Items*\ ” list, on
the “\ *Cutplane*\ ” selector in the attribute list for all plot items
(under the “\ *Cutplane*\ ” attribute), and in the legend (if its
“\ *Caption*\ ” attribute is enabled).

*Origin:* The origin (the point shared by the three-plane normals) of an
octant, wedge, or plane.

*Normal (1, 2, 3):* Defines the orientation of the indicated cutplane
via a normal vector. There are two of these controls on a wedge and
three on an octant; they are labeled with numerals (e.g., 1, 2, 3).

*Dip/DD (1, 2, 3):* Sets the dip and dip direction, respectively, of the
selected plane. There are two of these controls on a wedge and three on
an octant; they are labeled with numerals (e.g., 1, 2, 3).

*Snap View:* Snaps the view to a perpendicular orientation so that the
user sees the side of the plane.

*Wedge Angle:* Sets the angle of the wedge cutting plane.

*Caption:* When enabled, the plot item is shown (labeled, described, and
enumerated as needed) in the plot legend. The sub-attributes provided
are dynamic and contingent on the plot item and its display requirements
in the legend. At a minimum, all captions have “\ *Title*\ ” or *“Line”*
and “\ *Color”* sub-attributes.

3.4.1.13  Clip Box
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When applied to a plot item, the “\ *Clip Box*\ ” control constrains the
display of the plot item according to its size, position, and
orientation. It is similar to a cutplane in that it is applied to plot
items and, although a view can have multiple clip boxes in it, only one
clip box can be applied to a given plot item at a time. Both a cutplane
and clip box can be applied to a plot item simultaneously. The
attributes available for the “\ *Clip Box*\ ” controls and their
descriptions are given below.

*Name:* Sets or indicates the name of the clip box. This name is used to
label the clip box as it is listed in the “\ *Plot Items*\ ” list, on
the “\ *Clip Box*\ ” selector in the attribute list for all plot items
(under the “\ *Clip Box*\ ” attribute), and in the legend if its
“\ *Caption*\ ” attribute is enabled.

*Center:* Sets the position of the plot item’s center in model units.

*Dip:* Sets the dip of the clip box.

*Dip Dir:* Sets the dip direction of the clip box.

*Clip Axis (1, 2, 3):* Shows or hides the axis of the clip box indicated
by the numeral.

*Axis Radii:* Specifies the radius of clip axis 1, clip axis 2, and clip
axis 3, respectively, away from the current center.

*Axis Offsets:* Specifies the offset from the center of each of the
three axes.

*Interactive:* This option is not active in **MINEDW**.

*Caption:* When enabled, the plot item is shown (labeled, described, and
enumerated as needed) in the plot legend. The sub-attributes provided
are dynamic and contingent on the plot item and its display requirements
in the legend. At a minimum, all captions have a “\ *Title*\ ”
sub-attribute.

3.4.2  View
~~~~~~~~~~~

The “\ *View*\ ” sub-pane of the “\ *Control Panel*\ ” Pane (Figure
3.24) is discussed in this section. As shown in Figure 3.24, the
“\ *View*\ ” sub-pane is divided into two sections that can be minimized
independently and provides tools for manipulating (i.e., rotating,
magnifying, positioning) the view. The functions available in the
“\ *View*\ ” sub-pane are shown in Figure 3.24 and are described below.

|image41|

Figure 3.24  A “\ *View*\ ” pane and sub-panes

*3D Rotate:* Use the roller tool to rotate the view in 3-D.

*Reset View:* Re-centers the model in the View Pane and zooms to the
model extent.

*Slide Vertical Translation:* Change the vertical translation by
dragging the slider in the desired direction.

*Slide Rotation:* Change the rotation by dragging the slider in the
desired direction; rotation is normal (perpendicular) to the screen.

*Slide Horizontal Translation:* Change the horizontal translation by
dragging the slider in the desired direction.

*Slide Magnification:* Change the magnification level by dragging the
slider in the desired direction.

*Eye:* Reports the *x*, *y*, and *z* positions of the “\ *Eye*\ ” in
model coordinates. Enter the desired values in the boxes and press the
[Enter] key to “snap” the view as specified.

*Center:* Reports the *x*, *y*, and *z* positions of the view center in
model coordinates. Enter desired values in the boxes and press the
[Enter] key to snap the view as specified.

*Rotation:* Reports the dip, dip direction, and roll of the current View
Pane in model coordinates. Enter desired values in the boxes and press
the [Enter] key to snap the view as specified.

*Scale:* Describes the view’s radius (extent from view center to view
edge), eye distance, and magnification (respectively, from left to
right). Radius and magnification both affect the apparent magnification
of the view; however, radius uses a fixed angle for model perspective;
thereby, reducing the value makes the model appear closer, and
increasing the value makes the model appear farther away. In both cases,
the eye position is moved accordingly to satisfy the fixed angle of the
model perspective. Magnification increases or decreases the view without
changing the eye position but correspondingly changes the radius value.
The result is that increasing the value enlarges the model and reduces
the radius value, and decreasing the value reduces the model and
enlarges the radius value.

*Mode:* This option can be used to choose the view mode, which changes
the perspective of the View Pane.

*Clip:* Clips the view shown in the View Pane.
